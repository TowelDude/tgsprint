# TGSprint
This library was developed to help you easily create a telegram bot that has a menu.  
The library (currently) ONLY takes care of the menu stuff, and leaves the rest to you (based on PTB)  

I took most of my insipration from another great library [telegram_menu](https://github.com/mevellea/telegram_menu)

see `src/demo.py` for example usage
